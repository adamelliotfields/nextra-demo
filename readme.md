# nextra-demo

Spent a couple days playing with [Nextra](https://nextra.site). It's Next.js + MDX with lots of thoughtful additions. I'm also using Bun, Biome, Tailwind, and shadcn-ui.

Demo: [aef.me/nextra-demo](https://aef.me/nextra-demo/)

## Usage

```sh
# install bun
export PATH="${HOME}/.bun/bin:${PATH}"
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
bun dev
```
